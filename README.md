# IOT-Based-Flood-Monitoring-and-alerting-System-
An IoT-based system that monitors water levels in real-time using sensors. Data is sent to the cloud via Wi-Fi/GSM and alerts are triggered when thresholds are exceeded. Offers SMS/email/app notifications and a dashboard for effective flood management.
The IoT-Based Flood Monitoring and Alerting System uses IoT technology to monitor flood-
prone areas in real time. By deploying sensors to track water levels, rainfall, and soil moisture, the
system collects and transmits data wirelessly to a central platform. AI analyzes the data to predict
flood risks and trigger automated alerts to authorities and residents via mobile apps or SMS. This
system enables early detection, timely flood warnings, and efficient management, reducing
potential damage and improving safety during floods. It offers a scalable, real-time solution for
flood monitoring and disaster response.
